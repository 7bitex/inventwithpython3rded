License and Proceeds
====================

"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" was released with a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, making it freely available to download and distribute free of charge. The source code in the book is under an even more liberal Free BSD license. The 3rd edition book and code will be published under these licenses as well.

As the copyright holder, I commercially sell "Invent with Python" on Amazon. I also plan on selling hard copies of the translations as well, however:

*All proceeds from sales of translated books of "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 3rd Edition" will be donated to the Python Software Foundation.*

I make similar donations to the EFF, Tor Project, and Creative Commons nonprofits from sales of my other book, "Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python". I publicly post an accounting of these donations at http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/proceeds/

I appreciate the efforts of the translators to bring programming knowledge outside of the English-speaking world. I want them to know that I do not plan to personally profit off of their labor.

Suggested Guidelines for Translators
====================================

First, thank you for helping with the translation of "Invent with Python". Here are some helpful guidelines:

1. Look at the AUTHORS.md file to contact other translators working on your language.

2. Read the translations/README.txt file to note any special parts of the book

2. Translate the programs first. Do not change the order or position of the code, as that will require tedious updating of line numbers in the book.

3. Save the .py files of the programs with UTF-8 encoding. (This is the default encoding the Python 3 expects source files to be in.)

4. Make notes of any cultural differences that would require more than just a straight translation to the translations/README.txt file.

5. All of the files for a translation go into the translations/<language code> folder. This includes the text files, figure image files, and source code .py files.
