License and Proceeds
====================

"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" was released with a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, making it freely available to download and distribute free of charge. The source code in the book is under an even more liberal Free BSD license. The 3rd edition book and code will be published under these licenses as well.

As the copyright holder, I commercially sell "Invent with Python" on Amazon. I also plan on selling hard copies of the translations as well, however:

*All proceeds from sales of translated books of "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, 3rd Edition" will be donated to the Python Software Foundation.*

I make similar donations to the EFF, Tor Project, and Creative Commons nonprofits from sales of my other book, "Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python". I publicly post an accounting of these donations at http://inventwithpython.com/hacking/proceeds/

I appreciate the efforts of the translators to bring programming knowledge outside of the English-speaking world. I want them to know that I do not plan to personally profit off of their labor.
