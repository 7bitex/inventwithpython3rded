Do not modify the text files in this folder by hand. These are only updated by copy-pasting the text from the Word doc, then going through and removing the code and heading lines. Be sure there is a blank line separating each paragraph.

To get the readability scores, run the Python "readability" module (pip install readability) to generate the output which goes in the *.readability.txt files.

The goal is to get the wording down as close as possible to a Kincaid grade level of 8.0 and a Flesch score of 70.0.
