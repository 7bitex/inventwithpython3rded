The Reversi AI algorithm was simple, but it beats me almost every time I play it. This is because the computer can process instructions so fast. Checking each possible position on the board and selecting the highest scoring move is easy for the computer. But it would take me a long time to look at every space on the board and write down the score of each possible move.

The Reversi program in Chapter 14 had two functions, getPlayerMove() and getComputerMove() which both returned the selected move as a two-item list like [x, y]. They both had the same parameters, the game board data structure and which tile they were. getPlayerMove() decided which [x, y] move to return by letting the player type in the coordinates. getComputerMove() decided which [x, y] move to return by running the Reversi AI algorithm.

What happens when we replace the call to getPlayerMove() with a call to getComputerMove()? The human player would never type in a move since both X and O are controlled by getComputerMove(). The computer is playing against itself!

We are going to make three such programs, each based on the Reversi program in the last chapter:

•   AISim1.py, made by changing reversi.py, has the computer play against itself for one game.

•   AISim2.py, made by changing AISim1.py, has the computer play several games against itself.

•   AISim3.py, made by changing AISim2.py, has different computer AIs play against each other.

You can either type these changes in yourself, or download them from the book’s website at the URL http://invpy.com/chap16.

Save the old reversi.py file as AISim1.py by clicking on File and then Save As, and then entering AISim1.py for the file name and clicking Ok. This will create a copy that you can make changes to. The original Reversi source code will be left alone. Change the following code in AISim1.py:

To this (the change is in bold):

Run the program. The game still asks if you want to be X or O, but it won’t ask you to enter any moves. Replacing getPlayerMove() causes the program no longer takes input from the human player. You still press ENTER after the original computer’s moves (because of the input('Press Enter to see the computer\'s move.') on line 285), but the game plays itself!

Let’s make some other changes to AISim1.py. All of the functions (that is, the code before line 246) can stay the same. But replace the entire main section of the program (line 246 and on) to look like the following code. If you get errors after typing this code in, compare it to the book’s code with the online diff tool at http://invpy.com/diff/AISim1.

The AISim1.py program is the same as the original Reversi program, except that the call to getPlayerMove() has been replaced with a call to getComputerMove(). The print() calls are also changed to make the game easier to follow.

When you run the AISim1.py program, all you can do is press ENTER for each turn until the game ends. Run through a few games and watch the computer play itself. Since both the X and O players are using the same algorithm, the two players are evenly matched. Who wins is really just a matter of luck. The X player will win half the time, and the O player will win half the time.

Let’s make some changes to the source code so that the computer plays several games against itself all at once. Do the following to make AISim2.py:

1.  Click on File and then Save As.

2.  Save this file as AISim2.py so that we can make changes without affecting AISim1.py. (At this point, AISim1.py and AISim2.py will have the same code.)

3.  Make changes to AISim2.py and save that file. (AISim2.py will have the new changes and AISim1.py will have the original, unchanged code.)

Make your source code look like the following. The additions are in bold. Some lines have been removed. When you are done changing the file, save it as AISim2.py. If the changes are confusing, download the AISim2.py source code from the book’s website at http://invpy.com/chap16.

The new xwins, owins, and ties variables keep track of how many times X wins, O wins, and the ties. Lines 284 to 289 increment these variables at the end of each game, before it loops back to start a new game.

Most of the print() function calls were removed from the program. You also removed the calls to drawBoard(). When you run AISim2.py, it asks you how many games you wish to run.

Now that we’ve taken out the call to drawBoard() so that it doesn’t print the board after each move. The computer still plays an entire game, but all you’ll see are the scores at the end.

Replacing the while True: loop with a for game in range(numGames): loop lets you run a number of games without stopping for the user to type anything. Here is a sample run of ten computer vs. computer games:

Because the algorithm does have a random part, your run might not have the exact numbers as above.

Printing things out to the screen slows the computer down, but now that we have removed that code, the computer can run an entire game of Reversi in about a second or two. Think about it: Each time the program printed out one of those lines it ran through an entire game, each game with about fifty or sixty moves!

Percentages are a portion of a total amount, and range from 0% to 100%. If you had 100% of a pie, you would have the entire pie. If you had 0% of a pie, you wouldn't have any pie at all. 50% of the pie would be half of the pie. A pie is a common image to use for percentages. In fact, there is a kind of chart called a pie chart which shows how much of the full total a certain portion is. Here is a pie chart with 10%, 15%, 25%, and 50% portions below. Notice that 10% + 15% + 25% + 50% adds up to 100%.

We can calculate the percentage with division. To get a percentage, divide the part you have by the total, and then multiply by one hundred. For example, if X won 50 out of 100 games, you would calculate the expression 50 / 100, which would evaluate to 0.5. We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage (in this case, 50%).

Notice that if X won 100 out of 200 games, we could calculate the percentage with 100 / 200, which would also evaluate to 0.5. Multiply 0.5 by 100 to get the percentage. This comes to 50%. Winning 100 out of 200 games is the same percentage (that is, the same portion) as winning 50 out of 100 games.

It is important to note that when you use the / division operator, the expression will always evaluate to a floating point number. For example, the expression 10 / 2 will evaluate to the floating point value 5.0, not to the integer value 5.

This is important to remember, because adding an integer to a floating point value with the + addition operator will also always evaluate to a floating point value. For example, 3 + 4.0 will evaluate to the floating point value 7.0 and not to the integer 7.

Try entering the following code into the interactive shell:

Notice that in the above example, the data type of the value stored in spam is always a floating point value. You can pass the floating point value to the int() function, which will return an integer form of the floating point value. But this will always round the floating point value down. For example, the expressions int(4.0), int(4.2), and int(4.9) will all evaluate to 4, and never 5.

The round() function will round a float number to the nearest whole float number. Try entering the following into the interactive shell:

Whenever the fraction part of a number is .5 or greater, the number is rounded up. Otherwise, the number is rounded down.

The round() function also has an optional parameter, where you can specify to what place you wish to round the number to. For example, the expression round(2.5422, 2) evaluates to 2.54 and round(2.5422, 3) evaluates to 2.542.

The code at the bottom of the program will show the user how many wins X and O had, how many ties there were, and how what percentages these make up. Statistically, the more games you run, the more accurate your percentages will be.

If you only ran ten games, and X won three of them, then it would seem that X’s algorithm only wins 30% of the time. However, if you run a hundred, or even a thousand games, then you may find that X’s algorithm wins closer to 50% (that is, half) of the games.

To find the percentages, we divide the number of wins or ties by the total number of games. We convert numGames to a float to ensure we do not use integer division in our calculation. Then we multiply the result by 100.

However, we may end up with a number like 66.66666666666667. So we pass this number to the round() function with the second parameter of 2 to limit the precision to two decimal places, so it will return a float like 66.67 instead (which is much more readable).

Let’s try another experiment. Run AISim2.py again, but this time have it run a hundred games:

The program takes a while to finish. You can see that the results of all one hundred games still evens out to about fifty-fifty, because both X and O are using the same algorithm to win.

Let’s add some new Reversi AI algorithms. But first click on File, then Save As, and save this file as AISim3.py. Before the print('Welcome to Reversi!') line, add the following code:

A lot of these functions are similar to one another, and some of them use the new isOnSide() function. Here’s a review of the new algorithms we’ve made:

Now the only thing to do is replace one of the getComputerMove() calls in the main part of the program with one of the new functions. By running several games you can see how often one algorithm wins over the other. First, replace O’s algorithm with the one in getComputerMove() with getRandomMove() on line 351:

When we run the program with a hundred games now, it may look like this:

Wow! X won far more often than O did. That means that the algorithm in getComputerMove() (which makes the move that flips the most tiles) wins more games than the algorithm in getRandomMove() (which makes moves randomly). This makes sense. Making intelligent moves is going to be better than making random moves.

What if we changed O’s algorithm to also use the algorithm in getRandomMove()? Let’s find out by changing O’s function call on line 351 from getComputerMove() to getRandomMove() and running the program again.

As you can see, when both players are making random moves, they each win about 50% of the time. (In the above case, O happen to get lucky and won a little bit more than half of the time.)

Just like moving on the corner spaces is a good idea because they cannot be flipped, moving on the side pieces may also be a good idea. On the side, the tile has the edge of the board and isn’t as out in the open as the other pieces. The corners are still preferable to the side spaces, but moving on the sides (even when there is a move that can flip more pieces) may be a good strategy.

Change X’s algorithm on line 346 to use getComputerMove() (our original algorithm) and O’s algorithm on line 351 to use getCornerSideBestMove() (which first tries to move on a corner, then tries to move on a side position, and then takes the best remaining move). Let’s run a hundred games to see which is better. Change the function calls and run the program again.

Wow! That’s unexpected. It seems that choosing the side spaces over a space that flips more tiles is a bad strategy to use. The benefit of the side space isn’t greater than the cost of choosing a space that flips fewer of the opponent’s tiles.

Can we be sure of these results? Let’s run the program again, but this time let’s have the program play one thousand games. This may take a few minutes for your computer to run (but it would take weeks for you to do this by hand!) Try changing the function calls and running the program again.

The more accurate statistics from the thousand-games run are about the same as the statistics from the hundred-games run. It seems that choosing the move that flips the most tiles is a better idea than choosing a side space.

Now set the X player’s algorithm on line 346 to use getComputerMove() and the O player’s algorithm on line 351 to getWorstMove() (which makes the move that flips over the least number of tiles), and run a hundred games. Try changing the function calls and running the program again.

Whoa! The algorithm in getWorstMove(), which always choose the move that flips the fewest tiles, will almost always lose to our regular algorithm. This isn’t really surprising. (In fact, it’s surprising that this strategy wins even 2% of the time!)

How about when we replace getWorstMove() on line 351 with getCornerWorstMove(), which is the same algorithm except it takes any available corner pieces before taking the worst move. Try changing the function calls and running the program again.

The getCornerWorstMove() still loses most of the games, but it seems to win a few more games than getWorstMove() (6% compared to 2%). Does taking the corner spaces when they are available really make a difference?

We can check by setting X’s algorithm to getWorstMove() and O’s algorithm to getCornerWorstMove(), and then running the program. Try changing the function calls and running the program again.

Yes, it does seem like taking the algorithm that takes the corners when it can does translate into more wins. While we have found out that going for the sides makes you lose more often, going for the corners is always a good idea.

This chapter didn't really cover a game, but it modeled various strategies for Reversi. If we thought that taking side moves in Reversi was a good idea, we would have to spend weeks, even months, carefully playing games of Reversi by hand and writing down the results.

But if we know how to program a computer to play Reversi, then we can have the computer play Reversi using these strategies for us. If you think about it, you’ll realize that the computer is executing millions of lines of our Python program in seconds! Your experiments with the simulation of Reversi can help you learn more about playing Reversi in real life.

In fact, this chapter would make a good science fair project. Your problem can be which set of moves leads to the most wins against other sets of moves, and make a hypothesis about which is the best strategy. After running several simulations, you can determine which strategy works best.

You can make a science fair project out of a simulation of any board game! And it is all because you know how to instruct the computer to do it, step by step, line by line. You can speak the computer’s language, and get it to do large amounts of data processing and number crunching for you.

That’s all for the text-based games in this book. Games that only use text can be fun, even though there simple. But most modern games use graphics, sound, and animation to make much more exciting looking games. For the rest of the chapters in this book, we will learn how to create games with graphics by using a Python module called Pygame.
