So far, all of our games have only used text. Text is displayed on the screen as output, and the player types in text from the keyboard as input. Just using text makes programming easy to learn. But in this chapter, we’ll make some more exciting games with advanced graphics and sound using the Pygame module.

Chapters 17, 18, and 19 teaches you how to use Pygame to make games with graphics, animation, mouse input, and sound. In these chapters we’ll write source code for simple programs that are not games but demonstrate the Pygame concepts we’ve learned. The game in Chapter 20 will use all the concepts you’ve learned.

Pygame doesn’t come with Python. Like Python, Pygame is available for free. In a web browser, go to the URL http://invpy.org/downloadpygame and download the Pygame installer file for your operating system and version of Python.

Open the installer file after downloading it, and follow the instructions until Pygame has finished installing. To check that Pygame is install correctly, type the following into the interactive shell:

If nothing appears after you hit the ENTER key, then you know Pygame was successfully installed. If the error ImportError: No module named pygame appears, try to install Pygame again (and make sure you typed import pygame correctly).

The Pygame website at http://pygame.org has information on how to use Pygame, as well as several other game programs made with Pygame. Figure 17-1 shows the Pygame website.

This chapter has a few small programs that demonstrate how to use the different features that Pygame provides. In the last chapter, you’ll use these features for a complete game written in Python with Pygame.

The first Pygame program is a new “Hello World!” program like you created at the beginning of the book. This time, you’ll use Pygame to make “Hello world!” appear in a graphical window instead of as text.

Pygame doesn’t work well with the interactive shell because it relies on a game loop (described later). Because of this, you can only write Pygame programs and cannot send instructions to Pygame one at a time through the interactive shell.

Pygame programs also do not use the input() function. There is no text input and output. Instead, the program displays output in a window by drawing graphics and text to the window. Pygame program’s input comes from the keyboard and the mouse through things called events. Events are explained in the next chapter.

Type in the following code into the file editor, and save it as pygameHelloWorld.py. If you get errors after typing this code in, compare it to the book’s code with the online diff tool at http://invpy.com/diff/pygameHelloWorld.

When you run this program, you should see a new window appear which looks like Figure 17-2.

What is nice about using a window instead of a console is that the text can appear anywhere in the window, not just after the previous text we have printed. The text can be any color or size. The window is like a blank painting canvas, and you can draw whatever you like on it.

Let’s go over each of these lines of code and find out what they do.

First we need to import the pygame module so we can call Pygame’s functions. You can import several modules on the same line by delimiting the module names with commas. Line 1 imports both the pygame and sys modules.

The second line imports the pygame.locals module. This module contains many constant variables that we will use with Pygame such as QUIT or K_ESCAPE (which we will explain later). However, using the form from moduleName import * you can import the pygame.locals module but not have to type pygame.locals in front of the module’s functions.

The pygame.locals module contains some constant variables we will use in this program.

If you have from sys import * instead of import sys in your program, you could call exit() instead of sys.exit() in your code. But most of the time it is better to use the full function name so you know which module the function is in.

All Pygame programs must run this code by calling the pygame.init() after importing the pygame module but before calling any other Pygame functions.

Line 8 creates a GUI window by calling the set_mode() method in the pygame.display module. (The display module is a module inside the pygame module. Even the pygame module has its own modules!)

There are three parameters to the set_mode() method:

•   A tuple of two integers for the width and height of the window, in pixels.

•   A value for advanced GUI window options. You won't really need this, so just pass 0.

•   Another advanced option called the color depth. Just pass the value 32.

A pixel is the tiniest dot on your computer screen. A single pixel on your screen can turn into any color. All the pixels on your screen work together to display all the pictures you see. To create a window 500 pixels wide and 400 pixels high, use the tuple (500, 400) for the first parameter.

The set_caption() call returns a pygame.Surface object (which we will call Surface objects for short). Objects are values of a data type that have methods. For example, strings are objects in Python because they have data (the string itself) and methods (such as lower() and split()). The Surface object represents the window.

Variables store references to objects just like they store reference for lists and dictionaries. The References section in Chapter 10 explains references.

There are three primary colors of light: red, green and blue. By combining different amounts of these three colors, you can form any other color. In Pygame, tuples of three integers are the data structures that represent a color.

The first value in the tuple is how much red is in the color. A value of 0 means there is no red in this color, and a value of 255 means there is a maximum amount of red in the color. The second value is for green and the third value is for blue.

For example, the tuple (0, 0, 0) has no amount of red, green, or blue. The resulting color is completely black. The tuple (255, 255, 255) has a maximum amount of red, green, and blue, resulting in white.

The tuple (255, 0, 0) represents the maximum amount of red but no amount of green and blue, so the resulting color is red. Similarly, (0, 255, 0) is green and (0, 0, 255) is blue.

You can mix the amount of red, green, and blue to get any shade of any color. Table 17-1 has some common colors and their RGB values. The web page http://invpy.com/colors also lists several more tuple values for different colors.

A font is a complete set of letters, numbers, symbols, and characters drawn in a single style. Figure 17-3 shows the same sentence printed in different fonts.

In our earlier games, we only told Python to print text. The color, size, and font that was used to display this text was completely determined by your operating system. The Python program couldn’t change the font. However, Pygame can draw text in any font on your computer.

Line 19 creates a pygame.font.Font object (which we will call Font objects for short) by calling the pygame.font.SysFont() function. The first parameter is the name of the font, but we will pass the None value to use the default system font. The second parameter is the size of the font (which is measured in units called points).

The Font object that we have stored in the basicFont variable has a method called render(). This method will create a Surface object with the text drawn on it. The first parameter to render() is the string of the text to draw. The second parameter is a Boolean for whether or not we want anti-aliasing.

On line 22, pass True to use anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing blurs your text a little to make it look smoother. Figure 17-4 shows what a line (with enlarged pixels) looks like with and without anti-aliasing.

The pygame.Rect data type (which we will call Rect for short) makes working with rectangle-shaped things easy. To create a new Rect object call the function pygame.Rect(). The parameters are integers for the XY coordinates of the top left corner, followed by the width and height, all in pixels.

The function name with the parameters looks like this: pygame.Rect(left, top, width, height)

Just like methods are functions that are associated with an object, attributes are variables that are associated with an object. The Rect data type (that is, the data type of all Rect objects) has many attributes that describe the rectangle they represent. Here is a list of attributes of a Rect object named myRect:

The great thing about Rect objects is that if you modify any of these attributes, all the other attributes will automatically modify themselves also. For example, if you create a Rect object that is 20 pixels wide and 20 pixels high, and has the top left corner at the coordinates (30, 40), then the X-coordinate of the right side will automatically be set to 50 (because 20 + 30 = 50).

However, if you change the left attribute with the line myRect.left = 100, then Pygame will automatically change the right attribute to 120 (because 20 + 100 = 120). Every other attribute for that Rect object is also updated.

Notice that both the Font object (stored in the text variable) and the Surface object (stored in windowSurface variable) both have a method called get_rect(). Technically, these are two different methods. But the programmers of Pygame gave them the same name because they both do the same thing and return Rect objects that represent the size and position of the Font or Surface object.

The module you import is pygame, and inside the pygame module are the font and surface modules. Inside those modules are the Font and Surface data types. The Pygame programmers made the modules begin with a lowercase letter, and the data types begin with an uppercase letter. This makes it easier to distinguish the data types and the modules.

We create a pygame.Rect object by calling a function named pygame.Rect(). The pygame.Rect() function has the same name as the pygame.Rect data type. Functions that have the same name as their data type and create objects or values of this data type are called constructor functions.

You can always find out what the proper name of a value’s data type with the type() function. For example, try entering the following into the interactive shell:

(You need to call the pygame.quit() function when you are done with typing Pygame functions into the interactive shell. Otherwise you may cause Python to crash.) Notice that the return value from the type() function isn’t a string, but a value of a data type called “type”! Try entering this into the interactive shell:

For the most part, you don’t need to know about data types and the type() function when programming games. But it can be useful if you need to find out the data type of the value stored in a variable in your program.

We want to fill the entire surface stored in windowSurface with the color white. The fill() function will completely cover the entire surface with the color we pass as the parameter. (In this case, we pass WHITE to make the background white.)

An important thing to know about Pygame is that the window on the screen won’t change when we call the fill() method or any of the other drawing functions. These will change the Surface object, but the Surface object won’t be drawn on the screen until the pygame.display.update() function is called.

This is because drawing on the Surface object (which is stored in the computer’s memory) is much faster than drawing to the screen. It is much more efficient to draw onto the screen once and only after all of our drawing functions to draw to the surface.

A polygon is multisided shape with straight line sides. Circles and ellipses are not polygons. Figure 17-5 has some examples of polygons.

The pygame.draw.polygon() function can draw any shape you give it and fill the inside space of the polygon. The parameters, in order, are:

•   The Surface object to draw the polygon on.

•   The color of the polygon.

•   A tuple of tuples that represents the XY coordinates of the points to draw in order. The last tuple will automatically connect to the first tuple to complete the shape.

The parameters, in order, are:

•   The Surface object to draw the line on.

•   The color of the line.

•   A tuple of two integers for the XY coordinate of one end of the line.

•   A tuple of two integers for the XY coordinates of the other end of the line.

•   Optionally, an integer for the width of the line.

If you pass 4 for the width, the line will be four pixels thick. If you do not specify the width parameter, it will take on the default value of 1.

The parameters, in order, are:

•   The Surface object to draw the circle on.

•   The color of the circle.

•   A tuple of two integers for the XY coordinate of the center of the circle.

•   An integer for the radius (that is, the size) of the circle.

•   Optionally, an integer for the width. A width of 0 means that the circle will be filled in.

The pygame.draw.ellipse() function will draw an ellipse. It is similar to the pygame.draw.circle() function. The parameters, in order, are:

•   The Surface object to draw the ellipse on.

•   The color of the ellipse.

•   A tuple of four integers is passed for the left, top, width, and height of the ellipse.

•   Optionally, an integer for the width. A width of 0 means that the circle will be filled in.

The pygame.draw.rect() function will draw a rectangle. The third parameter is a tuple of four integers for the left, top, width, and height of the rectangle. Instead of a tuple of four integers for the third parameter, you can also pass a Rect object.

In line 45, we want the rectangle we draw to be 20 pixels around all the sides of the text. This is why we want the drawn rectangle’s left and top to be the left and top of textRect minus 20. (Remember, we subtract because coordinates decrease as you go left and up.) And the width and height are equal to the width and height of the textRect plus 40 (because the left and top were moved back 20 pixels, so we need to make up for that space).

On line 48 we create a pygame.PixelArray object (which we will call a PixelArray object for short). The PixelArray object is a list of lists of color tuples that represents the Surface object you passed it.

Line 48 passes windowSurface to the pygame.PixelArray() call, so assigning BLACK to pixArray[480][380] will change the pixel at the coordinates (480, 380) to be a black pixel. Pygame will automatically modify the windowSurface object with this change.

The first index in the PixelArray object is for the X-coordinate. The second index is for the Y-coordinate. PixelArray objects make it easy to set individual pixels on a PixelArray object to a specific color.

Creating a PixelArray object from a Surface object will lock that Surface object. Locked means that no blit() function calls (described next) can be made on that Surface object. To unlock the Surface object, you must delete the PixelArray object with the del operator. If you forget to delete the Surface object, you’ll get an error message that says pygame.error: Surfaces must not be locked during blit.

The blit() method will draw the contents of one Surface object onto another Surface object. Line 54 will draw the “Hello world!” Surface object in text and draws it to the Surface object stored in the windowSurface variable.

The second parameter to blit() specifies where on the windowSurface surface the text surface should be drawn. We will pass the Rect object we got from calling text.get_rect() (which was stored in textRect on line 23).

In Pygame, nothing is drawn to the screen until the pygame.display.update() function is called. This is because drawing to the screen is slow compared to drawing on the Surface objects in the computer’s memory. You do not want to update to the screen after each drawing function is called, but only update the screen once after all the drawing functions have been called.

You’ll need to call pygame.display.update() each time you want to update the screen to display the contents of the Surface object returned by pygame.display.set_mode(). (In this program, that object is the one stored in windowSurface.) This will become more important in our next program which covers animation.

In previous games, all of the programs print everything immediately until they reach a input() function call. At that point, the program stops and waits for the user to type something in and press ENTER. But Pygame programs are constantly running through a loop called the game loop. In this program, all the lines of code in the game loop execute about a hundred times a second.

The game loop is a loop that constantly checks for new events, updates the state of the window, and draws the window on the screen. Events are objects of the pygame.event.Event data type that are generated by Pygame whenever the user presses a key, clicks or moves the mouse, or makes some other event occur.

Line 59 is the start of the game loop. The condition for the while statement is set to True so that it loops forever. The only time we exit the loop is if an event causes the program to terminate.

Calling pygame.event.get() retrieves any new pygame.event.Event objects (called Event objects for short) that have been generated since the last call to pygame.event.get(). These events are returned as a list of Event objects. All Event objects have an attribute called type which tell us what type of event it is. (In this chapter we only deal with the QUIT types of event. The other types of events are covered in the next chapter.)

Pygame generates the QUIT event (which was imported from the pygame.locals module) when the user clicks on the X button at the top right of the program’s window. It is also generated if the computer is shutting down and tries to terminate all the programs running. For whatever reason the QUIT event was generated, we know that we should run any code that we want to happen to stop the program.

Line 60 has a for loop to iterate over each Event object in the list returned by pygame.event.get(). If the type attribute of the event is equal to the constant variable QUIT, then we know the user has closed the window and wants to terminate the program.

If the QUIT event has been generated, call both pygame.quit() and sys.exit().

This has been the simple “Hello world!” program from Pygame. We've covered many new topics that we didn't have to deal with in our previous games. Even though the code is more complicated, the Pygame programs can also be much more fun than text games. Let’s learn how to create games with animated graphics that move.

In this program we have several different blocks bouncing off of the edges of the window. The blocks are different colors and sizes and move only in diagonal directions. In order to animate the blocks (that is, make them look like they are moving) we will move the blocks a few pixels over on each iteration through the game loop. By drawing new blocks that are located a little bit differently than the blocks before, we can make it look like the blocks are moving around the screen.

Type the following program into the file editor and save it as animation.py. If you get errors after typing this code in, compare it to the book’s code with the online diff tool at http://invpy.com/diff/animation.

In this program, we will have three different colored blocks moving around and bouncing off the walls. In order to do this, we need to first consider how we want the blocks to move.

Each block will move in one of four diagonal directions. When the block hits the side of the window, it should bounce off the side and move in a new diagonal direction. The blocks will bounce as shown Figure 17-7.

The new direction that a block moves after it bounces depends on two things: which direction it was moving before the bounce and which wall it bounced off of. There are a total of eight possible ways a block can bounce: two different ways for each of the four walls.

For example, if a block is moving down and right, and then bounces off of the bottom edge of the window, we want the block’s new direction to be up and right.

We can represent the blocks with a Rect object to represent the position and size of the block, a tuple of three integers to represent the color of the block, and an integer to represent which of the four diagonal directions the block is currently moving.

On each iteration in the game loop, adjust the X and Y position of the block in the Rect object. Also in each iteration we will draw all the blocks on the screen at their current position. As the program execution loops through the game loop, the blocks will gradually move across the screen so that it looks like they are smoothly moving and bouncing around on their own.

In this program the size of the window’s width and height is used for more than just the call to set_mode(). We will use a constant variables so that if we ever want to change the size of the window, we only have to change lines 8 and 9. Since the window width and height never change during the program’s execution, a constant variable is a good idea.

Line 11 sets the window’s caption to 'Animation' by calling pygame.display.set_caption().

We will use the keys on the number pad of the keyboard to remind us which belongs to which direction. This is similar to the Tic Tac Toe game. 1 is down and left, 3 is down and right, 7 is up and left, and 9 is up and right. However, it may be hard to remember this, so instead we will use constant variables instead of these integer values.

We could use any values we wanted to for these directions instead of using a constant variable. For example, we could use the string 'downleft' to represent the down and left diagonal direction. However, if we ever mistype the 'downleft' string (for example, as 'fownleft'), Python would not recognize that we meant to type 'downleft' instead of 'downleft'. This bug would cause your program to behave strangely, but the program would not crash.

But if we use constant variables, and accidentally type the variable name FOWNLEFT instead of the name DOWNLEFT, Python would notice that there is no such variable named FOWNLEFT and crash the program with an error. This would still be a pretty bad bug, but at least we would know about it immediately and could fix it.

We will use a constant variable to determine how fast the blocks should move. A value of 4 here means that each block will move 4 pixels on each iteration through the game loop.

We set up constant variables for the colors we will use. Remember, Pygame uses a tuple of three integer values for the amounts of red, green, and blue called an RGB value. The integers are from 0 to 255.

Again, the use of constant variables is for readability. The computer doesn’t care if we use a variable named GREEN for the color green. But if we later look at this program, it is easier to know that GREEN stands for the color green rather than (0, 255, 0).

We will set up a dictionary to be the data structure that represents each block. (Chapter 9½ introduced dictionaries.) The dictionary will have the keys of 'rect' (with a Rect object for a value), 'color' (with a tuple of three integers for a value), and 'dir' (with one of our direction constant variables for a value).

The variable b1 will store one of these block data structures. This block has its top left corner located at an X-coordinate of 300 and Y-coordinate of 80. It has a width of 50 pixels and a height of 100 pixels. Its color is red and its direction is set to UPRIGHT.

Line 29 and 30 creates two more similar data structures for blocks that are different sizes, positions, colors, and directions.

On line 31 we put all of these data structures in a list, and store the list in a variable named blocks.

The blocks variable stores a list. blocks[0] would be the dictionary data structure in b1. blocks[0]['color'] would be the 'color' key in b1, so the expression blocks[0]['color'] would evaluate to (255, 0, 0). This way we can refer to any of the values in any of the block data structures by starting with blocks.

Inside the game loop, the blocks will move around the screen in the direction that they are going and bounce the block if they have hit a side. There is also code to draw all of the blocks to the windowSurface surface and call pygame.display.update(). Also, pygame.event.get() is called to check for the QUIT event.

The for loop to check all of the events in the list returned by pygame.event.get() is the same as in our “Hello World!” program, so let’s skip its explanation and go on to line 44.

First, fill the entire surface with black so that anything previously drawn on the surface is erased.

Next the code must update the position of each block, so iterate over the blocks list. Inside the loop, we will refer to the current block as simply r so it will be easy to type.

The new value that to set the left and top attributes to depends on the direction the block is moving. If the direction of the block (which is stored in the 'dir' key) is either DOWNLEFT or DOWNRIGHT, you want to increase the top attribute. If the direction is UPLEFT or UPRIGHT, you want to decrease the top attribute.

If the direction of the block is DOWNRIGHT or UPRIGHT, you want to increase the left attribute. If the direction is DOWNLEFT or UPLEFT, you want to decrease the left attribute.

Change the value of these attributes by the integer stored in MOVESPEED. MOVESPEED stores how many pixels over blocks move on each iteration of the game loop.

After lines 44 t o57 move the block, check if the block has gone past the edge of the window. If it has, you want to “bounce” the block. In the code this means set a new value for the block’s 'dir' key. The block will move in the new direction on the next iteration of the game loop. This makes it look like the block has bounced off the side of the window.

In the above if statement, the block has moved past the top edge of the window if the block’s Rect object’s top attribute is less than 0. In that case, change the direction based on what direction the block was moving (either UPLEFT or UPRIGHT).

Look at the bouncing diagram earlier in this chapter. In order to move past the top edge of the window, the block had to either be moving in the UPLEFT or UPRIGHT directions. If the block was moving in the UPLEFT direction, the new direction (according to our bounce diagram) will be DOWNLEFT. If the block was moving in the UPRIGHT direction, the new direction will be DOWNRIGHT.

Lines 66 to 71 handles if the block has moved past the bottom edge of the window. They check if the bottom attribute (not the top attribute) is greater than the value in WINDOWHEIGHT. Remember that the Y-coordinates start at 0 at the top of the window and increase to WINDOWHEIGHT because we passed WINDOWHEIGHT as the height in our call to pygame.display.set_mode().

The rest of the code changes the direction based on what our bounce diagram says.

This is similar to the above code, but checks if the left side of the block has moved to the left of the left edge of the window. Remember, the X-coordinates start at 0 on the left edge of the window and increase to WINDOWWIDTH on the right edge of the window.

This code is similar to the previous pieces of code, but it checks if the block has moved past the rightmost edge of the window.

Now that the blocks have moved, they should be drawn on the windowSurface surface by calling the pygame.draw.rect() function. Pass windowSurface because that is the Surface object to draw the rectangle on. Pass the b['color'] because this is the color of the rectangle. Pass b['rect'] because it is the Rect object with the position and size of the rectangle to draw.

Line 86 is the last line of the for loop. If you wanted to add new blocks, you only have to modify the blocks list on line 31 and the rest of the code still works.

After each of the blocks in the blocks list has been moved and bounced, call pygame.display.update() so that the windowSurface surface is draw on the screen.

After this line, the execution loops back to the start of the game loop and begin the process all over again. This way, the blocks are constantly moving a little, bouncing off the walls, and being drawn on the screen in their new positions.

The call to the time.sleep() function is there because the computer can move, bounce, and draw the blocks so fast that if the program ran at full speed, all the blocks would look like a blur. (Try commenting out the time.sleep(0.02) line and running the program to see this.)

This call to time.sleep() will stop the program for 20 milliseconds, or 0.02 seconds.

Remove the # from the front of line 90 so that the line is no longer a comment and becomes part of the program again. This time, comment out line 42 (the windowSurface.fill(BLACK) line) by adding a # to the front of the line. Now run the program.

Without the call to windowSurface.fill(BLACK), we do not black out the entire window before drawing the rectangles in their new position. The trails of rectangles appear because the old rectangles drawn in previous iterations through the game loop aren’t blacked out anymore.

Remember that the blocks are not really moving. On each iteration through the game loop, it redraws the entire window with new blocks that are located a few pixels over each time.

This chapter has presented a whole new way of creating computer programs. The previous chapters’ programs would stop and wait for the player to enter text. However, in our animation program, we are constantly updating the data structures of things without waiting for input from the player.

Remember in our Hangman and Tic Tac Toe games we had data structures that would represent the state of the board, and these data structures would be passed to a drawBoard() function to be displayed on the screen. Our animation program is similar. The blocks variable held a list of data structures representing things to be drawn to the screen, and these are drawn to the screen inside the game loop.

But without calls to input(), how do we get input from the player? In our next chapter, we will cover how programs can know when the player presses any key on the keyboard. We will also learn of a concept called collision detection.
